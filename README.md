# tcp intermediary project
This is a testing project where I will experiment with 
using intermediary servers between cleint-server connections.

I am motivated on this project to learn more about how I can 
protect a server using an intermediary to my main server.
Mostly just out of curiosity, but also becasue I wish to 
start implementing them into other projects in the future.

# individual sub-projects
tcp-authentication
  - Token based authentication project to protect against 
  unwanted direct client to server connections.
